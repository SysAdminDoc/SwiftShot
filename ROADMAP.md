# SwiftShot Roadmap

Roadmap for SwiftShot - a fast, bloat-free Greenshot replacement for Windows (Python + PyQt5 + Win32 GDI + WinRT OCR). Focus: adding the handful of features users actually miss from Greenshot + CleanShot X without bringing the bloat back.

## Planned Features

### Capture
- Delayed per-shape capture: select region, then countdown, then *takes fresh screenshot* of that exact area
- Multi-monitor DPI-aware scroll capture (currently single-monitor friendly)
- Scrolling capture for web apps using DevTools protocol where available (Chromium-only enhancement)
- Camera overlay and green-screen keying for "me + screen" tutorial captures
- GIF / MP4 short-recording with edit-after-capture frame picker
- Color-picker global hotkey that captures color under cursor to clipboard as hex

### Editor
- Layer system - each annotation on its own layer, reorder/toggle/opacity per layer
- Magic wand / heal tool (LaMa ONNX) for object removal
- Speech bubble tool
- Badge / number-sequence tool with custom shape presets
- Auto-redact patterns (emails, phone numbers, IP/MAC)
- Vector export to SVG alongside PNG

### Pin & workflow
- Multiple pin windows snapping to grid with saved layouts
- Pinned window annotations (scribble directly on a pinned shot and it updates)
- Drag-to-reference: any pinned image is a drag source for other apps
- Quick-share targets: Imgur anonymous, self-hosted endpoint, clipboard, file
- Watch folder - auto-ingest images dropped into a configured folder

### OCR
- Translate OCR output via offline translation model or user-chosen API
- Barcode/QR decoder tool
- OCR-region capture returns both image and recognized text in clipboard

### Performance & robustness
- Migrate PyQt5 -> PyQt6 (per CLAUDE.md preference)
- Static-link build to trim .exe size and cold-start time
- Instrumented crash-handler with GUI crash dialog that writes to `%APPDATA%\SwiftShot\crashlog.txt`
- Per-version auto-update via GitHub Releases (signed)

### Config & deployment
- Portable-mode flag (settings next to exe) for USB stick use
- Admin-install MSIX with winget manifest
- Context-menu integration (right-click a file -> "Open in SwiftShot editor")

## Competitive Research

- **Greenshot** - the baseline. SwiftShot intentionally strips plugins; document clearly what's missing (Imgur-one-click, Office export) and whether each is on the roadmap.
- **ShareX** - kitchen sink with upload destinations and workflow chains; SwiftShot should *not* re-add cloud plugins but can take the "upload destination" concept as an optional user-configured endpoint.
- **CleanShot X** (macOS, paid) - best-in-class scroll capture + GIF recording + instant overlay of last capture. Scroll capture and GIF recording are the two biggest remaining gaps.
- **Shottr** (macOS) - smart OCR + measurement tool; already mirrored for OCR and ruler. Copy their OCR-overlay UX that shows recognized text anchored to image regions.
- **Flameshot** (cross-platform, GPL) - simple edit bar after capture; similar philosophy. Match their hotkey discoverability (on-screen key hints during capture).

## Nice-to-Haves

- Relicense evaluation: GPL-3 -> MIT if all non-MIT transitive deps can be swapped out (would simplify distribution and align with house style)
- Dedicated "tutorial screenshot" preset stack (step-numbers + arrow + highlight + blur)
- Notion/Obsidian/Markdown clipboard-copy export ("paste as markdown image link")
- Built-in quick edit via single-key toolbar hover, no click required
- Per-app capture profiles (saved hotkeys + preset per foreground app)
- Plugin SDK - minimal Python file drops a new tool into the editor toolbar
- Linux port via X11/Wayland screenshot APIs as a longer-term stretch

## Open-Source Research (Round 2)

### Related OSS Projects
- https://github.com/greenshot/greenshot — Upstream reference; plugin model Greenshot supports (that SwiftShot intentionally drops) is worth documenting to not re-add accidentally
- https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX — Feature-rich C# alt; region/window/scrolling/timed/OCR capture, 80+ upload destinations, built-in editor
- https://github.com/flameshot-org/flameshot — C++/Qt cross-platform; great inline annotation UX
- https://github.com/ksnip/ksnip — Qt Greenshot-parity without Electron; "lightweight Greenshot" ethos parallels SwiftShot
- https://github.com/MaartenBaert/ssr — SimpleScreenRecorder, pipeline for adding a screencast mode
- https://github.com/scrotwm/scrot — Simple CLI capture; reference for CLI mode
- https://github.com/topics/screenshot-tool — Topic hub

### Features to Borrow
- ShareX scrolling-capture (stitch-scroll) — SwiftShot lacks this; important for docs/long pages
- Flameshot's inline toolbar pinned to the selection rectangle — rotates as selection moves, feels more modern than floating toolbar
- Ksnip's multi-selection shapes with drag-handle resize after commit (rare in Greenshot clones)
- ShareX workflow automation — "After capture -> [OCR, annotate, save, copy path, upload]" as a user-defined pipeline
- Timed capture + region lock (ShareX) — great for capturing menus that close on focus loss
- Built-in OCR (Tesseract) producing selectable text under the pixels (ShareX)
- CLI mode with argparse flags (`swiftshot --region 0,0,800,600 --out file.png`) for scripting (scrot precedent)

### Patterns & Architectures Worth Studying
- Annotation as immediate-mode canvas layer using PyQt6 QGraphicsScene (Flameshot's scene-graph approach translates cleanly)
- Plugin SDK ethos — Greenshot's failure mode was loading enterprise plugins nobody needed; SwiftShot should keep plugins optional and drop-in-folder style (`%APPDATA%\SwiftShot\Plugins\*.py`) with `Tool(ABC)` contract
- DPI-aware capture path (CLAUDE.md memory already mandates this); on multi-monitor with mixed DPI, enumerate via Win32 `EnumDisplayMonitors` + per-monitor-v2 context
- File-naming template system (`{app}_{yyyy-MM-dd_HH-mm-ss}`) with variable registry — ShareX's template engine is a good reference
- Clipboard-history integration for "paste as markdown image link" (Obsidian/Notion workflow)
